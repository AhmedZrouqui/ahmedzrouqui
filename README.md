### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Ahmed Zrouqui! I'm a front-end developer!

Hello :grin: , I'm a frontend developer based in Morocco, exactly Casablanca. I have been working as a Frontend dev (freelancer) for almost 2 years, I mainly have worked as a React developer with different clients all around the world.

I have solid experience with HTML CSS and Javascript (libraries and frameworks included), and I think that I can implement anything clients would love to see on their websites.

I touch on backend too, for I have some experience with NodeJs (NestJS) and Python (Django) :eyes: .

I'm passionate about gaming too :blush: , so I do some game development with Unity (C#)!

What I have ? REDUX :running:

Don't be shy, take a look at my repositories!
